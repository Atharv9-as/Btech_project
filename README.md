Quick Road Patch 
🚧 Quick Road Patch Rover

Quick Road Patch Rover is a semi-autonomous robotic system designed to detect potholes and assist in road repair. It improves road safety by identifying damaged areas and enabling controlled pothole filling.

⚙️ Features

Real-time pothole detection

WiFi-based remote control

Automated patching mechanism

3D-printed robotic arm

🛠️ Hardware

Arduino UNO

ESP8266 WiFi module

Ultrasonic sensors

Solenoid valve

3D-printed robotic arm

🔧 Working

Ultrasonic sensors detect potholes based on depth variation. The rover is positioned via WiFi control, and a robotic arm with a solenoid valve fills the pothole accurately.

🚀 Applications

Smart road maintenance

Urban infrastructure monitoring

Accident prevention
